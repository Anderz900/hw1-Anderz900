                        The most interested audience would be shareholders
                        in Tesla and workers in Tesla who are inclined to see their 
                        own company prosper. Of course, the rest of the audience 
                        are people who are interested in investing in either stocks,
                        or perhaps a new Tesla car. This graph conveys to the most
                        interested that despite a tough start, revenues are beginning
                        to grow exponentially. Tesla is beginning to be a dependable
                        corporation for technology and will continue to have a presence
                        in future markets.

                            encode and distinguishes the revenue and loss (categorical).

                              In this easily analyzable graph, readers will be looking at the 
                              lengths of the bars 
                              to compare the revenues and losses of each year. They will also 
                              take into account the proportion of loss and revenue each year
                              which is made apparent by nicely having losses, a term
                              associated with a value being decreased, be extended below 
                              into the negative space (below the x-axis).

                                  As the numbers do not lie nor are there any 
                                  scaling delusions, this is an honest graph. Since a 
                                  bar graph is very easy to read and conveys a pretty direct
                                  message, the graph is functional. The fact that there is not
                                  any other decorations make the graph simple and clean, giving
                                  some element of beauty. More importantly, the insightful message 
                                  transmitted will prove useful for the stated members of the audience
                                  who can be more positive with their future investments in technology, especially
                                  in Tesla. It could even be enlightening given the growing importance
                                  of technology. Due to all these factors, this visualization is indeed a good one.

                              The range of the audience is very broad. It can include anybody who
                              is invested in any of the shown companies and can also include workers of
                              those companies. This graph conveys the change in brand value over time. It 
                              can be a very useful graph if one wanted to understand the corporate
                              hierarchy in terms of popularity. It can also be helpful towards people
                              who are interested in investing in these companies in the near future, 
                              as company brand history could be a clear sign for investors.

                                  to distinguish one another. Lastly, the year itself is put in the bottom
                                  right and allows readers to keep track of brand values over time (ordinal).

                                      The graph's many variables could lead one to believe that it is 
                                      difficult to read, but it's interactivity truly facilitates the process.
                                      The moving bars over time reflect the comptetiveness of today's age, and one
                                      can easily see who is ranked first because the top winning company of brand value has 
                                      it's name on the bottom. Since the companies at the bottom are proportionally much less 
                                      than the top, there is enough space for a long name such as Mercedes-Benz to fit, making 
                                      the graph easy to read. Comparing the length of the bars for brand value is quite an easy 
                                      task as well, and the color of the companies deter confusing with another company. Lastly,
                                      the top growing companies shown on the bottom right can help the audience see how the top growing companies
                                      are trending.

                                          The many aspects to the graph allow for someone to gleam a lot of information
                                          making it an insightful graph. It's simplicity allow one to appreciate it's design
                                          and therefore there is a clear element of elegance. Of course, the sheer usefulness 
                                          of the interactive graph makes it very functional. It is also a graph that does not 
                                          distort the information of brand value so it a truthful represenation. Considering all
                                          of these aspects, this visualization is a very good one.

                              The audience is mainly apple customers, especially those who own
                              smartphones, and secondary would be any smartphone owner. The graphs
                              show the increasing price of the iPhone, and other smartphones. By comparing 
                              all this data, the message is that Apple is beginning to stop profiting
                              from the sale of iPhones, and now intend to profit more from their 
                              services.

                                  the horizontal lines encode the years (ordinal) and iPhone version

                                  per smartphone. The x-axis shows the year(ordinal) so as to present the revenue over time.
                                  The different colors of the lines encode the different companies (categorical).
                                  In the last graph the horizontal lines encode the smartphone shipments (quantitative)
                                  worldwide in billions and once again the years can be perceived in the 
                                  x-axis (ordinal). The different colors show the different companies (categorical).

                                      The fact that there are multiple graphs instead of
                                      one makes it very easy to read. On that note, the dots 
                                      that represent the different storage capacities facilitate 
                                      the year by year comparison as one moves down the grid. It is also
                                      easy to differentiate the extremes in prices. The lines on the 
                                      second graph allow one to catch trends in each companies' history.
                                      Being able to be differentiated by color disallows confusion with identifying
                                      the companies as well. The last graph's use of different colors make it easy
                                      to compare the proportions of Apple's shipments with everybody else. As 
                                      one get to the current years, Apple's decreased smartphone shipments reflects
                                      the message of the visualization.

                                          In terms of beauty, the amount of decorations is 
                                          kept varied and judiciously used; the clarity of the graphs is thereby highlighted.
                                          The use of three different graphs allow one to receive multiple perspectives,
                                          attributing the visualization a functional quality. Also, because the graphs' data agree
                                          with each other and the source of the data comes from the companies' own reports, the graphs
                                          are truthful. The price of mobile devices has long plagued customers with their prices, but 
                                          this report could prove fruitul for future interested customers. The graph is therefore enlightening
                                          and could be a great hint for them. All these reasons considered, the visualization is a great one.

                              Since there are not many objects or variables in the image, it is relatively lax
                              on the number of things to keep track of. But, the fact that it is a 3D image 
                              makes the comparison difficult to perceive. Since the stack of bottles is behind 
                              the Eiffel Tower, there could be error in perception as one has to not only compare 
                              the height of the water bottle stack, but also it's distance off in the background which 
                              could skew results. The resulting comparions makes it very difficult to read.

                                  The data comes from a reliable source, and the portrayal next to the Eiffel Tower
                                  seems accurate as well. Since there are no scales, there is less opportunity to be
                                  dishonest. Therefore this is an honest representation of the message. It is also beautiful 
                                  as our eyes only focus on the two objects that have considerable detail. It is also 
                                  important to know this fact as this corresponds to a global dilemma therefore it is enlightening.
                                  However, the fact there is no scale definitely takes functionality out of the picture. To have 
                                  a better comparison, there should be a scale comparing the height at the very least while still retaining 
                                  simplicity. In addition, while the message is clear, the representation of that message fails to be
                                  insightful due to stack and Eiffel Tower not being exactly next to one another. This could cause
                                  confusion and make someone arrive at a different conclusion. In other words, if this were art then it 
                                  would score highly, but as a visualziation it fails in too many areas and is therefore a bad one.

                                      If readers want to see how favorable a candidate was before or after 
                                      debate, then one only needed to see where the blue dot is in the x or y 
                                      axis which is easy to do. However, when one is trying to make a cumulative 
                                      comparison, there is not a direct comparison and if a candidate is closer to the 
                                      top right then one can say the candidate is popular in both aspects. Nevertheless,
                                      it can be hard to ascertain that and there is potential for confusion as it is not 
                                      straightforward.

                                          Since the data was accumulated through a survey, the data source is trustworthy
                                          and the graph also reflects the data. Therefore, it is truthful. However, while
                                          impressions can accurately be graphed both before and after debate, there is no clear
                                          cumulative effect of this, it is murky and therefore the graph is not optimal. Yet, like a radial
                                          graph, it has an element of beauty as a pattern seems to arise. The graph also gets interesting
                                          information that can prove useful in the political field, thereby making it insightful and enlightening.
                                          All things considered, since functionality is hugely important, this visualization fails to live up
                                          to it's idea.

                              The audience here is very specific as it corresponds to a ticket service. The audience is 
                              therefore those who have purchased the tickets, the employees managing the service, and those
                              who are interested in buying some tickets. The graph conveys that in the summer months of 2014 and after,
                              the employees have trouble keeping up with the demands of the tickets received. 
                              This graph is useful as it says that as soon as the 2 employees left, the demands became too 
                              harsh. In other words, the leave of employees can prove fatal for the business.

                                      The graph is indeed not hard to read, but there is a lot of wasted space.
                                      One might need to strain the eyes a bit to truly understand the difference 
                                      between the two lines after May. But one can still see the trend after losing 
                                      the two employees, a slow catch up that takes the rest of the year. When looking at
                                      the lines, the circles catch our eyes and is a good touch when comparing values 
                                      at certain points.

                                          This visualization is truthful as it comes from as reputable source, 
                                          and the graph does reflect the data. Also, there are no scaling errors, 
                                          and both lines follow the same y-axis. It is beautiful in the sense that 
                                          it's simple design does make the graph clear. However, it lacks some 
                                          functionality and while the message is heard, there could be better ways of
                                          addressing it. Since the difference between the two graphs is what matter, then that would be more
                                          appropriate. It could have been more insightful
                                          combining it into one graph. Also, it could have been even better if the graph was more zoomed into the 
                                          relevant area. Due to these mistakes, this visualization is not good but it is a good attempt.

                          I believe my redesign improves upon the original by a lot. The 3D aspect
                          of the first model throws the viewer off as he or she cannot tell 
                          if the mound of watter bottles is taller or not. As I added the scale and converted it to 2D,
                          my redesign made the graph much more functional as there are actual
                          quantitative values and a height can even be approximated to the stack. Consequently, the value
                          we can see now makes it insightful as we can compare our wasteful habits with a worldwide known
                          structure.
                          Secondly, the simplicity of my design can still be appreciated and therefore the element of
                          beauty is still there.

                              I think the 3D aspect of the original design may have looked prettier, but
                              the 2D graph still uses the same figures to have that artistic connection. In other words,
                              in terms of beauty, the simplicity that my redesign has now has not lowered the aesthetics 
                              of the orginal by much. With respect to everything else, my redesign is more functional, insightful,
                              and enlightening (environmmental preservation) so the trade-offs are worth it.

                          Pre-debate favorability was encoded with a vertical axis (position) on 
                          the left-hand side ranging from -1 to 1 (quantitative). Debate peformance was recorded with 
                          another vertical axis (position) but on the right-hand side with the same range as the last one (quantitative).

                                I completely changed the design, yet the simple aspect is still retained.
                                I decided to represent the cadidates' represenation of impression with lines
                                instead of points. I would gather the data 
                                from the previous graph, plot the points accordingly on the axes, and connect the lines.

                                  I think my visualization is a vast improvement from the original. The first one 
                                  had the characteristics of a radial graph, making it hard to see how two or more
                                  factors jointly affected the overall result. As there are only two factors of
                                  significant consideration, I believed calculating the slope between them by 
                                  simply doing the substraction of the second axis value from the first one gives one
                                  an accurate representation of how the impression changed. My graph also takes into account
                                  how valuable their contribution to the debate is with respect to their pre-debate favorability.
                                  In other words, a semi-bad peformance on debate by a well-respected candidate leaves a larger
                                  impression on the crowd than an even worse peformance by a much less known candidate. 
                                  The higher the impression ratio, the better the impression the candidate gave off. In other words, 
                                  the higher the slope, the better the impression. With that logic, the best impression was given off by
                                  O'Rourke (-0.23) and the worst was Sanders (-0.7). It also makes sense that all these ratios are negative 
                                  as the general trend should be that we are more impressed with the popularity of the candidate then when 
                                  actually faced with their arguments on debate day.

                                        While there are many 
                                        intersecting lines (a bit more messy) in my redesign, this allows us to better understand each candidate's overrall impression throughout
                                        the process and we can compare these changes by visualizing the lines, and slopes. Honestly, my graph does not have 
                                        any trade-offs other than that. The new visualization is a great improvement.

                              In this redesign the line graph notion is kept intact, and I took away the 
                              two different lines (and their categorical data) and kept one as that one line conveys that same information. The y position 
                              has a maximum of 50 as 46 is the maximum difference between the two original lines. I 
                              also added a dotted line to indicate when the employees quit for style purposes.

                                  I believe my graph is superior to the previous one. In the first place,
                                  the first graph wastes a lot of unnecessary space. I made sure that my vertical axis
                                  only got until 50 max. This made it a lot easier to see the change over time as it is literally
                                  calculating the slope. In fact, 
                                  from July to August we can see how the the new graph's curve over that interval is much more 
                                  pronounced, implying the company had much more trouble dealing with the sudden loss of employees. 
                                  In addition, from September to October one could miss in the first graph that there has been improvement
                                  with the situation, but in the new graph the change in concavity from those months clearly depict this much better.

                                      The only thing that could confuse people more is if they are not well acquainted 
                                      with the notion of slope. Therefore, the first graph could make it easier to understand, yet
                                      leave certain elements out of the reader's scope. Changing into the one curve instead of two 
                                      allowed for a direct answer to the error in my opinion anyhow. Everything else, I believe, was 
                                      an improvement.
